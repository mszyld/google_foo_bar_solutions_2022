# google_foo_bar_solutions_2022

This year I completed the Google "foo bar" challenge, I worked on very interesting problems and along the way I learned some more Python and Data Structures and Algorithms! I'm posting my solutions here as Jupyter Notebooks including the problem statements and some explanations of how the solutions work and the ideas involved. 

Problem List:
- Level_2_Part_1: Bunny Prisoner Locating
- Level_2_Part_2: Hey, I Already Did That!
- Level_3_Part_1: Prepare The Bunnies' Escape
- Level_3_Part_2: Doomsday Fuel
- Level_3_Part_3: Fuel Injection Perfection
- Level_4_Part_1: Escape Pods
- Level_4_Part_2: Running With Bunnies
- Level_5: Expanding Nebula

If you find any mistake or want to make a comment, feel free to contact me!

Note: I do not recommend copying these solutions if you are doing the challenge.
